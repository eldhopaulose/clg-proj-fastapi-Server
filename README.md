This is a code block that contains a Python script for a FastAPI web application. It uses various modules such as prediction, weather, data, pandas and time to perform different tasks. Here is a possible documentation for GitHub in README format:

# FastAPI Web Application

This is a web application that uses FastAPI framework to provide various endpoints for data analysis and visualization. It can fetch data from AWS, sensor data, weather data and rainfall prediction.

## Installation

To run this web application, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You also need to install the following packages:

- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pandas
- prediction
- weather
- data

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas prediction weather data
```

## Usage

To start the web server, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will launch the web server at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the following endpoints using your browser or a tool like Postman:

- `/` : This endpoint will return a JSON object with the filename of the AWS data that was fetched and saved as a CSV file.
- `/data` : This endpoint will return a JSON object with the sensor data that was fetched and saved as a CSV file.
- `/pd` : This endpoint will run the rainfall prediction module and return a JSON object with the predicted rainfall data for Kerala state in India.
- `/weather` : This endpoint will fetch the current weather data for London city using the weather module and return a JSON object with various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, conditions, etc.

You can also access the interactive documentation for the web application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs or http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc.
